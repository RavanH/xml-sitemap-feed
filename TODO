= 5.6 =
* RSS feeds: detect excerpt setting with admin warning or auto-change setting (?), suggest advanced plugin for improved compatibility
* lastmod for users
* revise SEO plugin compatibilty and conflict notices: maybe just recommend using SEO plugin sitemap, or completely ignore unless real conflict?
* include home page even if pages are excluded, but HOW ???
* dummy dynamic slug field for google news advanced
* DROP automatic priority calculation
* DROP theme template overrides
* revisit Polylang compatibility
* switch to Exclude post types
* change SEO compatibility warning messages (advise to use the seo plugin sitemap or upgrade to Advanced plugin?)

* optimize plugin index:
  - can we prevent default queries? maybe do not update/prime meta caches etc?
  - can we cache lastmod data as transients?
* Make leaner still: only load sitemap class and functions on xmlsf_sitemap_loaded ... same for news.
* Combine images: attached includes featured
* Make Polylang lastmod dates per language

* revisit get_lastmodified and/or _get_post_time: replace with core functions and some kind of caching maybe...
* revisit expensive meta_query for _xmlsf_exclude: maybe collect all posts with _xmlsf_exclude (and noindex?) occasionally and store their IDs for faster exclusion in db query... or or or better yet... store exclude IDs not as meta but in one DB option in the first place?

NEW
* remove post types that are not activated from admin tab

General settings for Home page:
* get_home_priority() : allow editable priority >>> homepage priority
* Consider: Option for lastmod date for (static) front and blog pages (PRO?):
	- last publication date for post post type
	- page modification date
	++ advanced options

TEST
* Nginx Helper purge wildcard not working?
* test/fix outdated lastmod dates for post type sitemaps when Redis Cache is active

ROADMAP
* move sitemap fields (back) to Sitemap class?
* rethink xmlsf_post_types and optional xmlsf_post_type_settings
* drop dynamic priority?

DOCUMENT
* Images in sitemaps, see https://wordpress.org/support/topic/how-to-include-featured-attached-images-in-xml-sitemap-not-one-or-the-other/
* xmlsf_blogpages
* xmlsf_frontpages
* xmlsf_register_news_sitemap_provider
* xmlsf_register_news_sitemap_provider_after
* xmlsf_add_settings
* xmlsf_news_add_settings
* xmlsf_clear_news_settings
* add inline comment blocks for hooks

CONSIDER
* featured + attached images option
* Reset button per settings tab
* compatibility with https://wordpress.org/plugins/page-links-to/ ? option to automatically exclude linked posts... but not by default?
* make sitemaps_enabled use static value for faster repsonse
* Get rid of the whole feed business...
* Quick edit colums sortable
* Move automatic priority calc + update lastmod on comments to General section or drop automatic priority?
* make prime meta caches (async crawler?)
* Automatic priority calculation for authors or drop automatic priority?
* drop all WP pre-5.5 and ClassicPress compatibility routines?
* core sitemap stylesheets per sitemap type (is that possible?)
* drop all publisher center links ? see https://support.google.com/news/publisher-center/answer/14859160
* Polylang news name option in translation strings? Or fix news name to blog name?
* move away from feed templates, adopt ?sitemap=... approach from core
* dynamic stylesheets
* revisit/regroup views

CORE SITEMAP:
* TODO Maybe add dedicated Media sitemap if image tags are (still) not possible OR completely replace the renderer?
* add custom post type root pages... with a separate "root" sitemap or in the main pages sitemap?
